Finding the cloest pair of points on a two-dimensional surface.

#### Sch2.1

If n tasks are assigned to n people, the cost of assigning i_th work to the j_th person is c<sub>ij</sub>. Try to design an algorithm that assigns only one task to each person and minimizes the total cost.

### Sch2.2

Assume n tasks can be completed by k machines that can work in parallel, and the time required to complete task is t<sub>i</sub>. Try to design an algorithm to find out the best scheduling to complete these n tasks, so that the time to complete all tasks is the earliest.
